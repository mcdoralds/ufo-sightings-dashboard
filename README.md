# UFO Sightings
## Project Overview
This project takes UFO sightings data in .csv form from Kaggle and allows users to interact with it through a webpage. The webpage contains a filterable table of the sightings and allows users to search & filter by date, location, or description of the UFO in the witness testimonial.

#### Background
<i>The truth is out there. </i>

The following is a testimonial from a real-life encounter with an extra-terrestial being. For legal purposes, the following story is a work of fiction.

          It was a typical clear night in the rural outskirts of town, 
          the kind where the stars seem close enough to touch if you reach out. 
          I was driving back from my late shift, 
          the road ahead of me illuminated only by my headlights and the occasional flicker of a distant porch light. 
          The silence was almost soothing after a long day of hard work. 
          That's when I first saw it--- a faint light in the sky, not a star, 
          but moving too erratically to be an airplane.
          
          At first, I thought it was a drone, maybe a hobbyist taking advantage of the clear night. 
          But as I continued driving, the light seemed to follow, growing brighter and more intense. 
          My stomach dropped. I wasn't just seeing things; this light was moving with purpose. 
          It zigzagged across the sky, then suddenly, it was directly overhead, casting a blinding glow over my car.
          
          The engine died. The dashboard lights flickered out, plunging me into darkness. 
          My heart raced as I tried to restart the car, but it was as if the vehicle had been completely drained of power. 
          That's when the silence of the night was broken by a soft, almost inaudible hum. 
          It seemed to resonate from the object above, vibrating through the air and into my bones. 
          
          I remember feeling an overwhelming sense of dread, 
          the kind you feel when you know something bad is about to happen but you're powerless to stop it.
          I don't know why I got out of the car. Maybe part of me thought running was a better option than waiting. 
          But as soon as my foot hit the ground, I froze. 
          There, not ten feet from me, was a figure. 
          It was unlike anything I've ever seenâ€”tall, impossibly thin, with skin that seemed to absorb the light around it. 
          Its eyes, if you could call them that, were large, unblinking, and utterly emotionless.
          
          I couldn't move. Couldn't scream. It was as if I was trapped in my own body, a silent observer to what was about to unfold. 
          But then, as quickly as it appeared, it retreated, turning away from me and disappearing into the night. 
          The light above vanished, and just like that, my car roared back to life.
          
          I drove home in a daze. I know what I saw wasn't a trick of the light or a figment of my imagination. 
          It was real, as real as the fear that has haunted me every night since.
          I've never spoken about this encounter before, partly because I fear I won't be believed, 
          and partly because I'm not sure I want to know what really happened that night. 
          But there's one thing I'm certain of: we are not alone, and the truth is far more terrifying than we can imagine.

### Features
- Table visualization of imported data
- Multiple(non-case sensitive) filters (search through the database to find witness reports by date, city, state, country, or UFO shape.)

## Future Development
- Bigger dataset
  - Increase date range 
  - Connect to a larger or live database that is constantly updated with sightings e.g. MongoDB
  - Possibly scrape data to populate into table
- User Submission
  - Give users ability to submit UFO sightings
- Fact check 
  - Use a webscraper to cross reference submissions
